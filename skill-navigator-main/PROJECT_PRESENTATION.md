## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title:** The Hiring Challenge
**Visuals:** Split screen image. Left: A frustrated job seeker with a "rejected" email. Right: A stressed recruiter buried under a mountain of paper resumes.
**Content:**
*   **Keyword Dependency:** Traditional ATS systems are "dumb." They rely on exact keyword matches. If a job asks for "ML" and you write "Machine Learning," you might get rejected.
*   **The Resume Black Hole:** 75% of resumes are never seen by a human eye. Candidates feel ignored; Recruiters are overwhelmed with spam.
*   **Skill Mismatch:** It's difficult to distinguish between a candidate who *has* the skills and one who just *formatted* their resume correctly.
*   **Inefficiency:** Manual screening takes an average of 23 hours per hire for a single role.

## Slide 8: The AI Advantage
**Title:** How It Works
**Visuals:** A diagram showing "Text" -> "Vector Embedding" -> "Similarity Search".
**Content:**
*   **Vector Embeddings:** We convert resumes and job descriptions into high-dimensional mathematical vectors.
*   **Cosine Similarity:** We calculate the "distance" between a candidate's vector and a job description's vector.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** This allows the system to recognize that "Java" is related to "Spring Boot" and that "Team Lead" implies "Leadership" skills, even if the words aren't explicitly stated.

2.  **Process:** The system extracts text (OCR) and generates embeddings.
3.  **Analyze:** AI compares the profile against industry standards or specific job descriptions.
4.  **Result:** The user receives a detailed Score, specific Feedback, and tailored Recommendations.
